# Lecture Notes: Class 01

- Due Dates in Canvas
  - Retros are always due by midnight the same day they are assigned.
    - I want you to reflect on your most recent learning and have that fresh in your mind.
    - these CANNOT be late
  - Readings are due right before class starts
    - readings are assigned the same day as the labs
    - except for the Regex101 reading...
  - Code Challenges and Labs are due no later than the start of the next class day
    - EXAMPLE: Monday/Tuesday's CC & Labs will be due no later than Thursday at 6:30pm.
  - Career Assignments
    - Turn these in whenever you can.
    - You will not lose points for late submissions on these.
    - HOWEVER, do NOT fall behind and have a bunch of Career Assignments due at the end of the 9 weeks.
